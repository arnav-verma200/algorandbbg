🔗 **Deployed on TestNet:** [View Contract](https://lora.algokit.io/testnet/application/745553642)

---

## 🔹 Project Description

**BookLibrary** is a simple decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Algorand blockchain**.
It demonstrates how to create and interact with a smart contract using **TypeScript**, making it an excellent starting point for developers new to Algorand.

This project works as a **Book Library**, allowing users to store and fetch book details directly on-chain while showcasing the use of **Global State** in Algorand smart contracts.

---

## 🔹 What It Does

* 📖 Stores a book’s **title** and **author** in Algorand global state
* ➕ Function to **add a new book**
* 🔍 Function to **retrieve the last added book**
* 🛠️ Serves as a clear and minimal example of Algorand contract programming

---

## 🔹 Features

* ✅ Built with **TypeScript**
* ✅ Beginner-friendly smart contract example
* ✅ Demonstrates **Global State** storage
* ✅ Includes `AddBook()` and `GetBook()` functions
* ✅ Easy to extend for handling multiple books

## 🔹 Smart Contract Code

```ts
// paste your code here
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BookLibrary.git
   cd BookLibrary
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Deploy the contract to Algorand TestNet**

## 💡 Future Improvements

* 📚 Support for **multiple book entries** instead of overwriting
* 🔒 Add **ownership restrictions** (only contract creator can add books)
* 🌐 Build a **frontend UI** for easy interaction
* 🔎 Extend with **search and list features**
