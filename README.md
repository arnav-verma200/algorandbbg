## 🔹 Project Description
BookLibrary is a simple decentralized application (dApp) built on the **Algorand blockchain**.  
It showcases how to create and interact with a smart contract using **TypeScript**, making it a beginner-friendly introduction to Algorand development.  

This project is structured as a **Book Library**, where users can store and fetch book details directly on-chain. It’s perfect for developers exploring how global state works in Algorand contracts.

---

## 🔹 What it does
- Stores a book’s **title** and **author** in Algorand global state.  
- Provides a function to **add a new book**.  
- Offers a function to **retrieve the last added book**.  
- Serves as a clear and minimal example of Algorand contract programming.

## 🔹 Features
- ✅ Written in **TypeScript**  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly smart contract example  
- ✅ Uses **Global State** for data storage  
- ✅ Includes `AddBook()` and `GetBook()` functions  
- ✅ Easy to extend for handling multiple books

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/XXX.git
   cd XXX
   ```
2. Install dependencies
